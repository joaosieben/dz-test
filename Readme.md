# DZ Test | Jo√£o A. P. Sieben.

This Landing page was developed as a test only. It uses:
 * [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/), as task-runner,
 * [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/pt-BR/), as package manager, and
 * [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), to preprocess CSS files.

In order to view the page, you should acces the contents of `build/` folder. All the images, CSS and JS files are processed, minified and updated there, as you can see described in `Gruntfile.js` tasks.

The page was **not** developed in responsive patterns, once this was made in a few days, based only in a desktop PSD.

Thanks for the attention!
